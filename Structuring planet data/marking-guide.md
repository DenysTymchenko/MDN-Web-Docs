# Steps to complete
The following steps describe what you need to do to complete the table example. All the data you'll need is contained in the planets-data.txt file. If you have trouble visualizing the data, look at the live example above, or try drawing a diagram.

<ol>
	<li>Open your copy of blank-template.html, and start the table off by giving it an outer container, a table header, and a table body. You don't need a table footer for this example.</li>
	<li>Add the provided caption to your table.</li>
	<li>Add a row to the table header containing all the column headers.</li>
	<li>Create all the content rows inside the table body, remembering to make all the row headings into headings semantically.</li>
	<li>Ensure all the content is placed into the right cells â€” in the raw data, each row of planet data is shown next to its associated planet.</li>
	<li>Add attributes to make the row and column headers unambiguously associated with the rows, columns, or rowgroups that they act as headings for.</li>
	<li>Add a black border just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers.</li>
</ol>
